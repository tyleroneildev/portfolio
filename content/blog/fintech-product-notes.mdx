Financial software is often complex by design. Not because money is inherently
complicated, but because complexity creates leverage. When systems are hard to
understand, people are more likely to defer decisions, accept defaults, and
stay dependent on institutions that do understand them.

What gets lost in that complexity is the user.

### Complexity by design

It's usually easier to make something complicated than it is to make it simple.
Adding features, options, and explanations is straightforward. Removing them
requires restraint. It requires understanding what actually matters and being
confident enough to leave the rest out. In software, simplicity is rarely the
result of doing less work - it's the result of doing more.

### Simplicity is harder

Personal finance adds another layer to this problem: language. The space is
filled with jargon and insider terminology that assumes prior knowledge. If you
already know the language, it feels efficient. If you don't, it feels
alienating. Confusion is often framed as a personal failure rather than a
design one.

### Language and exclusion

But money is emotional. People come to financial tools with anxiety,
uncertainty, and very different starting points. Pretending otherwise doesn't
make those feelings disappear - it just excludes people who need clarity the
most.

This is why I think simplicity in financial software is a form of empathy.
Simple doesn't mean shallow or underpowered. It means fewer decisions, clearer
defaults, and information presented when it's actually useful. It means
respecting the user's time, attention, and mental energy.

This mindset shapes how I think about building financial products. When
something feels complicated, I try to ask whether the complexity is necessary
or just convenient for the system. The goal isn't to remove all complexity, but
to make sure it's earned.

Simple software makes better decisions easier.
